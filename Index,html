Hello!  My Name is Gideon Cline, and I am Currently a Student at Delaware County Community College (DCCC) soon to be graduating as well.  Currently, I am 25 years old, and working on a degree in Game Development.  Ever since I was young, I have enjoyed playing video games, and I aspire to create my own.  As a result, I have found a great love for mainly every part of making one, from the basic coding, to designing of graphics, to even level design and complex physics.  I have taken several history classes due to an interest in it, and as far as I am concerned, any information that I take in, in one way or another can be used in developing a game of some sort.
